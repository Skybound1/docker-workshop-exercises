## Storage

### Exercise 1

Run an `alpine` container while mounting your hosts `/tmp` to somewhere in the container.

Get a shell on your running container and check that you can read/write files from the mount volume.

### Exercise 2

Repeat the same exercise with a named volume.

### Exercise 3

Use the "Pro Tip" to navigate to your container's file system from a shell on your host.
